# Blog-backend

This is just the backend for my blog front end

This is deem finish by me and will (probably) not get updated anymore

Check the [frontend](https://github.com/ThienDuc3112/Reactjs-blog-frontend)

To run, add a .env file with 
- `DATABASE_URL`: Link to our mongodb database
- `AUTH_TOKEN`: Random key for JWT purposes
- `BASE_URL`: The link of the frontend for emailer to use
- `EMAIL` and `EMAIL_PASS`: For nodemailer, using gmail
- `PORT`: Optional
